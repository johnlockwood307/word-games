This is a React + NextJS project that simulates Anagrams, a word game by GamePigeon.

Players form words from six random letters. Longer words are awarded more points.

Users play individually to aim for the highest score.

Players who enter a nickname have their scores recorded in a Firestore database.

The leaderboard displays the top 10 recent scores and top 10 highest scores.
